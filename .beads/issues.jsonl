When a user selects a cluster, we can only show items from the initial 100 pulled - there's no way to query Algolia for 'the rest' of that cluster because similarity-based clusters don't translate to filters.\n\n## Key Insight\nIf clusters were defined by **decision rules** (conjunctions/disjunctions of facet filters), we could:\n1. Show the cluster as a rule: \"brand:Samsung AND color:Pink\"\n2. Query Algolia with that filter to get the FULL result set\n3. Support pagination within a cluster\n4. Enable true drill-down\n\n## Approaches to Explore\n\n### A. Rule-based clustering (like RIPPER)\n- Find rules that partition the result set\n- Each cluster IS a filter expression\n- Pro: Direct Algolia integration\n- Con: May not capture \"fuzzy\" similarity groups\n\n### B. Cluster-then-describe\n- Keep similarity clustering for grouping\n- Post-process: find the minimal filter that captures each cluster\n- Pro: Best of both worlds?\n- Con: Filter may over/under-match the similarity cluster\n\n### C. Decision tree partitioning\n- Build a decision tree on facets\n- Each leaf = a cluster defined by the path (AND of conditions)\n- Pro: Interpretable, maps to filters\n- Con: May create unbalanced clusters\n\n### D. Frequent itemset / association rules\n- Find common facet combinations\n- Groups emerge from co-occurrence patterns\n- Pro: Data-driven rules\n- Con: May not cover all items cleanly\n\n## Questions\n- Is \"fuzzy similarity\" actually valuable, or do users want crisp filterable groups?\n- Should clusters overlap, or be mutually exclusive?\n- How does this relate to the existing RIPPER approach?","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-29T13:55:35.2159-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-30T09:37:58.723337-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-30T09:37:58.72334-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ize-q4v","depends_on_id":"ize-p2q","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-29T13:55:35.21867-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
